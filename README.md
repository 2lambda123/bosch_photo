This is a copy of the photo package from bosch\_drivers

git svn checkout from here:
http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bosch-ros-pkg/code/trunk

and the git filter-branch for just bosch\_drivers/photo

Moved to the catkin build system, builds under ROS Groovy.

It should probably be checked out into a directory called "photo"
to keep catkin happy, this seemed like a bad repository name.
